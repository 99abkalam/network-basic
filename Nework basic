### Computer Network full free course

1. **What is network?**
- -  A computer network is defined as a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information

- 4. Wide Area Network --> WAN

### OSI model (open system interconnection)
1. Application layer
2. Presentation layer
3. Session layer
4. Transport layer
5. Network layer
6. Datalink layer
7. Physical layer

    ### 1.Aplication layer

    - flaming

    ### 7.Physical layer

    - medium
    - bit synchronization
    - transmission type
    - tranimission mode
    - topology
    - multiplexing
    - singal type

### Network topology
- A network topology is the physical and logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a network.

   - **6 type of network topology**
         - Star topology
         - bus topology
         - ring topology
         - mesh topology
         - tree topology
         - hybrid topology

         1. Star topology is a network topology in which each network component is physically connected to a central node such as a router, hub or switch
         2. Bus topology is a specific kind of network topology in which all of the various devices in the network are connected to a single cable or line.
         3. A ring topology is a network configuration where device connections create a closed circular data path. Each networked device is connected
         4. A mesh topology is a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another.
         5. A tree topology is a sort of structure in which each node is related to the others in a hierarchy.
         6. As the term suggests, hybrid topology is a type of network topology in which two or more different topologies are integrated or combined to lay out a network. In layman's terms, hybrid topology is the combination of two or more networks. The network type could be Star, Ring, Bus, or Mesh.

### Public IP, Private IP, Global IP, Local IP, Static IP, Dynamic IP
   1. **Public>>** A public IP address is an outward-facing IP address used to access the Internet. Public IP addresses are provided by an internet service provider (ISP) and assigned to the router. It is a unique IP address on the Internet.
   2. **Private>>** Your network has a range of (private) IP addresses that your router can assign to your devices at a given time, as the devices connect or disconnect to the web.
   3. **Global>>** A global IP address is meant to be publicly accessible from the Internet. A local-scope IP address is not routable to the Internet. This means that if your device is assigned local-scope address, your device will not be able to access the Internet, however you will still be able to access campus network resources.
   4. **Local>>** A Local IP address is the identifier (IPv4 or IPv6) that is assigned to your laptop, PC, mobile and any other device within your local network.
   5. **Static>>** If your computer is hosting a web server, its IP address is what identifies it to the rest of the Internet. A computer on the Internet can have a static IP address, which means it stays the same over time, or a dynamic IP address, which means the address can change over time.
   6.**Dynamic>>** A dynamic IP address is an IP address that an ISP lets you use temporarily. If a dynamic address is not in use, it can be automatically assigned to a different device. Dynamic IP addresses are assigned using either DHCP or PPPoE

### TCP (transmission control protocol)
   - connection oriented
   - reliable
   - error controlis mandatory
   - slow transmission
   - more overhead(20.60)
   - flow control congestion
   - http,ftp,smtp

### (User Datagram Protocol)
   - connection less
   - less reliable
   - error control is options
   - fast transmission
   - less overhead(8 byte)
   - no flow,congestion control
   - dns,bootp,dhcp,rip
